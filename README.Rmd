## README

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

log_file <- read_rds("log.rds") %>% 
  mutate(`date-accessed` = as.POSIXct(`date-accessed`, 
                                      format = "%b %d %Y %X")) %>% 
  filter(`date-accessed` %in% max(`date-accessed`)) %>% 
  rename(date = `date-accessed`)
```

This is a proof-of-concept example of web-scraping the <http://shark-references.com/> database. 

The database was last scraped:  __`r as_date(log_file$date)`__.

Currently there are __`r sum(log_file[,-1])`__ references, including __`r log_file[,2][[1]]`__ scraped from <http://shark-references.com/> and __`r log_file[,3][[1]]`__ added manually (i.e. not currently in <http://shark-references.com/>).
